PyBank:
We are tasked with creating a Python script that will analyze the financial records of our company. We will be given a financial dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

Our task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:
-The total number of months included in the dataset
-The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
-The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
-The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
-The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

We are tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process.

We will be given a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". Our task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:
